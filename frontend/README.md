# Frontend Directory

## 🚀 Overview
This is the frontend for the project, built with:

- **Vite** – fast development server and build tool  
- **React.js** – component-based UI library  
- **JavaScript** – application logic  
- **Material UI (MUI)** – component styling and design system  
- **Node.js + npm** – dependency and script management  

This document explains how to install dependencies, run the app locally, build for production, and understand the project structure.
